# 👋 Hi there!
> My name is Ness, I have been a web developer for 5 years and I love programming and designing websites. I found this passion for programming through my uncle and I've been developing this ability ever since. It's in this field that I discovered a real passion and a real future job that is the web developer.

I am currently working on various more or less complex projects which are :
 - ✍ Objective HTML (A programming language with HTML like syntax):

 - 🍿 Popscript (A very simple programming language):

 - 🖼 Landing page template (A free-to-use template for your projects):

 - 🏠 Portfolio (My website):

 I'm also trying out new programming languages such as:
 - 📚 Rust:
